			<h1>All Keys Video Guide</h1>
			<p>This video shows the location of every Key in order. If you want to use the original guide, or if you need help on a specific Key, it can be found below.</p>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ImDuLN3pQFo" title="All Keys" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<h2 id="1">Key 1</h2>
		  	<p>Mach Dash into the wall above the entrance to the Elevator room on Floor 1.</p>
			<h3>Common Issues:</h3>
			<ol><li>You can't continue to break through the wall until you have 25 Keys. It is not necessary to progress.</li></ol>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vGQSddUHiZs" title="Key 1" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<h2 id="2">Key 2</h2>
			<p>Talk to Snick in the SAGE Building, then the Key spawns in the block to the left of Oregano Mirage.</p>
			<h3>Common Issues:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Contrary to popular belief, breaking the block before talking to Snick doesn't prevent the key from spawning.</li>
				<li>There is a very rare softlock that can happen if you don't talk to Snick before you have 5 Keys. Ask on Discord if you believe this happened to you.</li>
			</ol>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GrYFBF_FuFc" title="Key 2" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<h2 id="3">Key 3</h2>
			<p>Super Jump up to the right facing wall to the left of Gnome Forest, then Shoulder Bash a little less than half way up the wall.</p>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WMeJlKWJbLQ" title="Key 3" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<h2 id="4">Key 4</h2>
			<p>Super Jump slightly to the left of The Three-Cheese Tundra, then Shoulder Bash into the left wall when you’re almost at the top.</p>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XenVascCgds" title="Key 4" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<h2 id="5">Key 5</h2>
			<p>Super Jump past the one way platform to the right of You bring a light?, then Shoulder Bash right into the corner.</p>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aZeBpteuVBY" title="Key 5" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<h2 id="6">Key 6</h2>
			<p>In the Floor 1 Secret room, shoot the gate with a pistol bullet (using the “Pistol Chainsaw” side attack, not Vigilante’s pistol).</p>
			<h3>Common Issues:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>If no bullet is fired, enter a level and immediately exit.</li>
				<li>If the door doesn't break, talk to GPB in the <a href="help-1.1#void">Void Room</a> and verify you have the previous 5 Keys.</li>
			</ol>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I6rlKE50CYA" title="Key 6" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<h2 id="7">Key 7</h2>
			<p>While outside of the SAGE Building, input the Konami Code (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A) using the arrow keys to become Mario. Now enter the building and press up on the Bloodsauce Dungeon machine to enter 1-1. Play through the level to find the Key where the top of the flag would normally be.</p>
			<h3>Common Issues:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>You have to use a keyboard. Press the arrow keys and the B and A keys.</li>
				<li>Mario can do a “wall jump” if you fail to collect the Key, just mash jump while running into a wall.</li>
				<li>When returning to Peppino, you will have to jump before the last A press, or you'll get stuck in the floor.</li>
			</ol>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ox7522mlfsQ" title="Key 7" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

			<h2 id="9">Key 9</h2>
