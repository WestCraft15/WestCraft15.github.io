			<h2>Mimic Toppins</h2>
			<p>Mimics are a rare kind of Toppin that can appear at any time. Upon entering a room with a Toppin, there is a 0.1%* chance that the Toppin will become a mimic. Exiting and reentering the room will reset the Toppin and reroll the RNG. When a Toppin becomes a mimic, it has a 50% chance to play a distorted cry for help. Upon being collected, it will play the collect sound at 80% speed, and has a 50% chance to play a very loud sound. Mimic Toppins are entirely black, and retain the shape of whichever Toppin they replaced. Other than that, they function identically to normal Toppins and only serve to scare the player occasionally.</p>
			<p>*When talking to GPB, he may mention the Mimics, stating that they are only there to harm you. This is misleading, as they do nothing other than jumpscare you. Reading this dialog will raise the chances of a Toppin becoming a Mimic to 50% until the next one spawns.</p>
			<h2>The Void Room</h2>
			<audio controls><source src="assets/mu_pizzaboy.ogg" type="audio/ogg"></audio>
			<p>This is the music that plays in the Void Room, as well as the Pizzaboy Clone rooms. It contains a speech of unknown origin (possibly religious?). A rough transcript is provided below.</p>
			<p>0:34 - [Unintelligible]</p>
			<p>0:39 - Coming on down, coming on down today</p>
			<p>0:43 - A resurrection</p>
			<p>0:46 - I [Unintelligible] to the whole bloody world</p>
			<p>0:50 - Raining, and raining, and raining, [flank] still raining.</p>
			<p>0:55 - To what life [like time] of the world can be?</p>
			<p>0:59 - [Secure] so many matters</p>
			<p>1:01 - Ha-zi-est, to what [Unintelligible]</p>
			<p>1:07 - [Unintelligible, perhaps another language?]</p>

			<p>This is the music that plays in Purgatory. It's taken from the Yume Nikki OST. It was also used in the April Fools build.</p>

			<h2>Crustavo</h2>
			<p>Crustavo exists solely to say vague and ominous things to scare the player. None of his dialog is actually relevant.</p>
			<ul style="font-size: 16px;">
				<li>Floor 1.1: I've been seeing more and more cracks around in this tower. This place has seen better days...</li>
				<li>Floor 1.2: Something freaky is going on around this tower. Oh well!</li>
				<li>Floor 2.1:  I was on the fifth floor and I thought I saw something hiding near a door. Havent been up there since...</li>
				<li>Floor 2.2: Dum de dum... hopefully no one finds my Dark Secret... that would be unfortunate...</li>
				<li>Floor 3.1: Something crawled into the ground on the floor below us. You know anything about that?</li>
				<li>Floor 3.2: My mother is ill. Last thing she did before her illness ailed her was go into some weird room.</li>
				<li>Floor 4.1: My brother went missing in one of the secret hub rooms. They never found him.</li>
				<li>Floor 4.2: That blocky Janitor fellow is being a real nuisance.</li>
				<li>Floor 5.1: Boy, this floor is kind of spooky! I'm quaking in my tiny crust boots!</li>
				<li>Floor 5.2: Do you hear that?</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="padding-top: 24px">His dialog in each location changes after you collect 25 Keys.</p>
			<ul style="font-size: 16px;">
				<li>Floor 1.1: I keep seeing more and more things crawling around here... it's freaking me out a little bit...</li>
				<li>Floor 1.2: Something freaky is going on around this tower. Oh god help me!</li>
				<li>Floor 2.1: That thing on the fifth floor... I swear I keep seeing it... like it's following me...</li>
				<li>Floor 2.2: Someone found out about my Dark Secret... so I had to take care of them.</li>
				<li>Floor 3.1: I keep hearing voices whispering to me. Do you think I should see a doctor?</li>
				<li>Floor 3.2: Mother told me to keep being me! She's so supportive.</li>
				<li>Floor 4.1: Aha... ahahah... I keep seeing things crawl in the corner of my eye and it's driving me crazy!</li>
				<li>Floor 4.2: I swear I've seen that janitor guy doing shady stuff around here...</li>
				<li>Floor 5.1: Aaaaah! You scared me! Next time you sneak up on me, make sure to take me out!</li>
