			<h2>The Void Room</h2>
			<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/242513887&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false"></iframe>
			<p>This is the music that plays in the Void Room, as well as several secret areas. It's taken from the Yume Nikki OST.
			<br>The Void Room can be accessed in the same way as in v1.1. However, you will now be met with an infinitely looping white plane with only occasional decoration. Shadow Pizzaboy can be found by running far enough in either direction.</p>
			<h2>Shadow Pizzaboy</h2>
			<img src="assets/spr_heaven-af23.png">
			<p>Shadow Pizzaboy is a new entity that can be found in the Void Room.</p>
			<p>Dialog:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It seems as if you've broken the laws of reality, and have come to me.<br>Frail, young and lost. Just like the others...<br>Tell me... Can you see the truth too?<br>Staring down at us...<br>Judging...</li>
				<li>Do you know where we are?<br>Lost between worlds...<br>The one below us...<br>He is coming... and sooner than you think.</li>
				<li>Something above you...<br>Maybe up there is where the answers you're looking for are...<br>Are you sure of where you're headed?</li>
				<li>In your search... you failed to remember...  what happened last time.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Silver Coneboy</h2>
			<p>Silver Coneboy is a new entity that appears on top of the tower once you've collected all 8 Keys. He says a line of dialog and closes your game, resetting your keys in the process.</p>
